# NACE predictor API


## Prerequisites

## Providing the API with data

## Running the application

### Locally

### As a GCP App Engine service

### As anything else

The application is a "plain" Flask Python app, and should be simple to package for 
use in other services (such as Kubernetes). 

Files for App engine deployment (app.yaml, .gcloudignore) can be ignored safely.
